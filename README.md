# D-Flip-Flop Calculator
JavaScript web application to assist students with verifying D-Flip-Flop logic circuit timing diagrams interactively.
User can add D input, reset_n, preset_n, and load_enable inputs interactively and compare their manual results to that of the application.

##Intention
The idea to create a D-Flip-Flop timing diagram "verifier" came about while I was a Teaching Assistant for a 2nd year Digital systems course.
I often saw students struggling to complete accurate timing diagrams due to a flip-flops output depending on multiple input states.
By creating this web application students have a resource to use to check that their own timing diagrams are correct.
